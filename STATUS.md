## Last updated

2026-04-29 — Batch 1 v2 patched per owner review issues. All four Batch 1
specs remain in DRAFT v2; owner approval still pending.

## Patches applied — 2026-04-29

Owner review of Batch 1 v2 raised 5 corrections; this patch round applies
them plus the 5 stale cross-references previously logged here. All four
Batch 1 specs remain `wip` and DRAFT v2; nothing is approved yet.

### Owner-review corrections

1. **PHASES.md Phase 1 contradiction.** Migration logging was forbidden by
   the blanket DML ban. Phase 1 Allowed/Forbidden replaced to permit narrow
   writes (`INSERT` into `wp_configkit_migrations`, `UPDATE` of the
   `configkit_db_version` option, idempotent built-in seed inserts) while
   keeping destructive ops, product writes, and runtime/UI writes
   forbidden.

2. **WooCommerce dependency clarity.** STATUS.md note rewritten to state
   WC must be installed and active before Phase 3 entry. PHASES.md Phase 3
   gains an entry-criteria section requiring "WooCommerce installed and
   active".

3. **Phase reorder.** Excel Import + Diagnostics + Product Readiness Board
   moved from old Phase 6 to new Phase 4. Frontend renderer is now Phase 5;
   Cart/Order is Phase 6; Phase 7 unchanged. CLAUDE.md phase table updated
   to match. Reason: owner mission is fast product creation through Excel +
   reusable lookup tables/libraries + diagnostics + preview. Owner must be
   able to upload products and lookup tables before frontend polish.

4. **Greenfield clarification in TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md §6.** Paragraph
   added stating that legacy data (Sologtak, scraped products, prior
   ConfigKit) enters via one-time import/migration only; no live dual-read
   legacy engine is supported for sol1.

5. **Stale cross-references resolved.** See list below.

### Stale cross-references resolved

- `CLAUDE.md` line 30: `docs/STATUS.md` → `STATUS.md`.
- `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md` §4: `DATA_MODEL.md §3.2` → `DATA_MODEL.md §3.6`
  (template_versions).
- `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md` §5: `DATA_MODEL.md §3.7` → `DATA_MODEL.md
  §3.15-§3.16` (import_batches and import_rows).
- `PHASES.md` Phase 4 (was Phase 6) diagnostics: `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md
  §11` → `AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` (Batch 2). §11 of TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md is
  "Open questions"; diagnostics is not defined in that document.
- `PHASES.md` Phase 7 perf measurement: `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md §10` →
  `TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md §6` (Performance budgets). §10 was "What this
  document does not cover".

All four Batch 1 specs remain DRAFT v2. Awaiting owner approval to flip
Batch 1 rows from `wip` to `complete`.
